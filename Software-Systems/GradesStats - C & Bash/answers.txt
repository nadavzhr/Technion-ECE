Q1.
We "recycled" alot of code between the various C programs, mainly the batch of codes in the main function
that are responsible for the input validity checks and setting-up the file descriptors channels.
Furthermore - in all of the auxiliary functions we checked for validity of the grades (if they are in range or not).
We could minimize this repetition of code lines by compiling these batches of code as unique programs
(each function with its own responsibilty), then we could set up our own library which has all of our own-built functions,
include it in our C programs,and then instead of writing the exact batches of code in every program,
we could call our functions, which will minimize the code and make it shorter and probably more readable.

Q2.
No, the numbers generated by this command are not uniformly distributed.
This is because the commands generates a random integer in the range [0, 32767]
which is a random int that is the size of 15-bits (32767 = 2^15-1).
Therefore when we perform the %100 operator, the numbers 0-67 have a slightly higher
probablity of being randomized by the function, than the rest of the numbers which are 68-99.
